Jafar is a JAX-based implementation of the DeepMind paper "[Genie: Generative Interactive Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15391)" (Bruce et al., 2024).

Jafar supports training of all Genie components and can complete the CoinRun reproducibility experiment (Appendix F) on a single L40S GPU in under a week.

<h2 name="start" id="start">Setup ðŸ§— </h2>

Jafar was built with `python 3.10` and `jax 0.4.30`. To install requirements, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Before training the models, generate the CoinRun dataset by running:

```bash
python generate_dataset.py --num_episodes 10000
```

Note: this is a large dataset (around 100GB) and may take a while to generate.

<h2 name="train" id="train">Quick Start ðŸš€ </h2>

Genie has three components: a [video tokenizer](models/tokenizer.py), a [latent action model](models/lam.py), and a [dynamics model](models/dynamics.py). Each of these components are trained separately, however, the dynamics model requires a pre-trained video tokenizer and latent action model.

To train the video tokenizer (similar for the LAM), run:

```bash
python train_tokenizer.py --ckpt_dir <path>
```

Once the tokenizer and LAM are trained, the dynamics model can be trained with:

```bash
python train_dynamics.py --tokenizer_checkpoint <path> --lam_checkpoint <path>
```

Logging with `wandb` is supported. To enable logging, set the `WANDB_API_KEY` environment variable or run:

```bash
wandb login
```

Training can then be logged by setting the `--log` flag:

```bash
python train_tokenizer.py --log --entity <wandb-entity> --project <wandb-project>
```
